Copies of old passports and the visas and entry stamps they contain can be submitted as evidence.
Skilled worker potential of spouses or life partners: Are you married or in a partnership and would like to come to Germany with your partner on an opportunity card? If your partner already meets the requirements for an opportunity card, you will be awarded one point in the points system. With this in mind, he or she can also do the self-check: opportunity card. 
Please note that all information you provide in the above categories must be supported by appropriate evidence or certificates for the visa application.

In this case, the Federal Employment Agency (BA) must approve your qualification measure.
Proof of German language proficiency: you must be able to demonstrate a knowledge of German, usually at level A2 of the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR). Please note that a higher level of German proficiency may also be required to participate in qualification measures in Germany.

Options after successfully completing the qualification measure
Once you have successfully completed your qualification measure and gained full recognition, you can stay in Germany for up to 12 months to find a qualified job. To do this, you need a residence permit for jobseekers (Section 20 (3) No. 4 of the Residence Act [AufenthG]), which you can apply for at the competent foreigners authority without having to leave the country. During this time, you are permitted to perform any kind of work.

If you have already found a job, a place on a degree programme or a vocational training place after completion of your qualification measure, you can apply for a residence permit at the competent foreigners authority and stay in the country without having to leave it first. It is possible to change to the following residence titles:

Residence permit for skilled workers
EU Blue Card
Residence permit for vocational training
Residence permit for study purposes
Special case: Visa for implementation of a skills analysis
If the recognition procedure cannot be carried out for reasons such as missing or incomplete documents, it is possible to apply for a visa for implementation of a skills analysis in Germany. 
The skills analysis assesses whether the applicant can demonstrate their professional knowledge and skills in practice. The competent body in Germany will decide on the skills analysis. The conditions for issuing a visa are as follows:

The competent recognition body has determined that a skills analysis is required in your case. You will normally have received a letter from the competent body.
You have applied for and been accepted for a skills analysis in Germany.
You can demonstrate that you are able to cover your living costs in Germany for this period. This is usually evidenced by a blocked bank account with a minimum of €1,091 per month (in 2025) or a declaration of commitment.
You have a level of German that corresponds to the skills analysis, usually at level A2 or above of the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR).
The visa for implementation of a skills analysis in Germany is issued for a maximum of six months. Find out more about the visa process in the “Entry and visa process” section. 

If it is determined that compensation measures are required before your qualification can be considered equivalent, your stay may be extended to allow you to participate in appropriate qualification measures.


Visa for vocational training
Vocational training in Germany opens many doors and is the best way to prepare yourself for the world of work in Germany. There are two options: you can either complete school-based or in-company vocational training. In either case, you may need a residence title under Section 16a of the Residence Act (AufenthG).

What are the requirements for a visa for vocational training?

Proof of language proficiency: You have the language skills required for qualified vocational training. You will normally require German language skills at level B1 of the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR). This is the case if the training institution has not yet tested your language skills or if you have not yet completed a preparatory German course.
Ability to cover the cost of living: You must be able to cover your living costs for the entire duration of your stay. In general, this means that you must be able to prove that you have at least €959 per month (as of 2025). If you plan to follow school-based vocational training, you can prove your ability to cover your living expenses by opening a blocked bank account or by submitting a declaration of commitment. In the case of in-company vocational training, you will receive an allowance, which can also serve as proof. If your future vocational training allowance is insufficient, you can make up the difference by showing that you have either a blocked bank account or a declaration of commitment.

In the case of in-company vocational training, part of the visa procedure may involve having to obtain the approval of the Federal Employment Agency (BA), which assesses, e.g. whether you are to be employed under the same conditions as German apprentices. This is an internal agency procedure that does not require any action on your part.
